Courseware for Engineering Software as a Service
================================================

a/k/a UC Berkeley CS 169 Software Engineering, a/k/a CS 169.1x/169.2x on
EdX

This repo contains information useful to instructors (and arguably
students) using the [ESaaS](http://www.saasbook.info) course materials.

The recommended setup is to [use Cloud9](https://github.com/saasbook/courseware/wiki/Setting-up-Cloud9).  We no longer support
prebuilt virtual machine images.  The [wiki](https://github.com/saasbook/courseware/wiki) has other setup options, but
not all are thoroughly tested, and none are officially supported.

The Wiki also contains information on each of the autogradable homeworks,
which are public repos named `saasbook/hw-*`.  (The corresponding
private `saasbook/hw-*-ci` repos contain the autograder files and
reference solutions for each homework.)  The `-ci` repos are generally
off limits except to [registered SaaS instructors](https://www.saasbook.info/instructors).
